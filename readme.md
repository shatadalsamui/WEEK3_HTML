# DOM & Todo App Examples

## Overview

This repository contains several HTML files demonstrating basic and advanced manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript, as well as simple Todo list application examples. These files are intended for hands-on learning and experimentation with DOM methods and event handling.

## Contents


- `adding-elements.html`  
  A Todo list example with functionality to add and delete tasks.

- `dom.html`  
  Demonstrates a basic Todo list and DOM manipulation.

- `dom2.html`  
  A minimal HTML file for DOM testing ("hi there").

- `todo2.html`  
  Another Todo list interface with "Add Todo" functionality.

- `TODOAPP.html`  
  A simple Todo app interface for adding tasks.

- `links`  
  A text file with useful resources for learning about the DOM:
    - [What is DOM? (Notion)](https://petal-estimate-4e9.notion.site/What-is-DOM-1c149bdbc15a433cace6c50d536725a0)
    - [Basics of DOM (100xDevs)](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/dom-1/Basics-of-DOM-1)
    - [DOM Advanced (100xDevs)](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/dom-2/DOM-Part-2--1)

## How to Use

1. **Open any HTML file in your browser** to see the example in action.
2. **Experiment with the code** by editing the HTML files and reloading your browser to observe changes.
3. **Refer to the `links` file** for external resources and deeper learning on DOM concepts.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Practice adding, editing, and deleting elements dynamically.
- Explore event handling and user interaction in the browser.
- Build and enhance simple Todo list applications.
